                    <h2>THE 7 SERIES:</h2>
                    <span>G70 is the internal designation for the seventh generation of the BMW 7 Series, a range of
                        luxury cars produced by the German luxury vehicle manufacturer BMW since July 2022.

                        Introduced in April 2022, 7 Series and i7 are the respective designations for BMW's internal
                        combustion and battery electric full-size luxury flagship models. BMW had unveiled the model on
                        20 April 2022 during the nameplate's 45th anniversary. Sold as a 2023 model, it is longer
                        than its predecessor model. This model offers petrol and diesel models, come standard with a
                        48-volt mild hybrid powertrain; a plug-in hybrid system is available.[10] Additionally, this
                        model is also the first 7 Series offer a mild hybrid powertrain. The seventh-generation BMW
                        7 Series is often collectively referred to as the G70.

                        The G70 commenced production on 1 July 2022, exactly seven years after the previous model.
                        The i7 is the first 7 Series to offer a fully electric powertrain, which shares powertrains with
                        the smaller G60 i5. Both 7 Series and i7 offer optional rear-or all-wheel drive
                        drivetrains. The V12 model is no longer offered, instead gets replaced by the M760e plug-in
                        hybrid.</span>

                    <h2>THE s-class:</h2>
                    <span>The Mercedes-Benz S-Class, formerly known as Sonderklasse (German for "special class",
                        abbreviated as "S-Klasse"), is a series of full-sized luxury sedans, limousines and armored
                        sedans produced by the German automaker Mercedes-Benz. The S-Class is the designation for
                        top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz models and was officially introduced in 1972 with the W116, and
                        has remained in use ever since. The S-Class is one of the flagship vehicles for Mercedes-Benz.

                        The S-Class has debuted many of the company's latest innovations, including drivetrain
                        technologies, interior features, and safety systems (such as the first seatbelt
                        pretensioners).[3] The S-Class has ranked as the world's best-selling luxury sedan.[4] In
                        automotive terms, Sonderklasse refers to "a specially outfitted car." Although used colloquially
                        for decades,[citation needed] following its official application in 1972, six generations of
                        officially named S-Klasse sedans have been produced.</span>
